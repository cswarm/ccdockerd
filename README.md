# ccdockerd

This is the repository server for [ccdocker](https://github.com/jaredallard/ccdocker).

Written in ES6/7.

## Running it

```bash
$ node index.js
```

It's running on port `8081`

## Images

Images are quickly stored on the fs, in `./images/<name>/<version>`. `latest` will
always refer to the most recently uploaded version. It's very basic right now.
